IMPORTANT: all costs are now given in $2015! As long as the model runs in $2005, the values need to be converted in datainput.gms
inco0       Initial investment costs given in $(2015)/MWh(energy capacity, power capacity is given separately by E/P ratio)
mix0        Fraction of output that is produced by this technology in 2005. This value can be overwritten in the calibration process; also, it often does not add up to 1.
eta         Conversion efficieny, i.e. energy output divided by energy input (for all but nuclear plants, there it is TW energy output over MT Uranium input)
omf         Fixed operation and maintenace costs given as a fraction of investment costs
omv         Variable operation and maintenance costs given in $(2015)/MWh energy production
lifetime    given in years
incolearn   Difference from inco0 to floor investment costs, given in $(2015)/MWh(output)
ccap0       Cumulated capacity in 2005 given in TW
learn       Learning rate given in percent cost reduction per doubling of cumulated capacity
